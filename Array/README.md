## Tips to solve problems

- Always check the input range of problem
- Many of the problem's condition checks revolve around input range of the problem
- Sorting problems have hidden need of hash table to store elements with their indexes and perform work for result based on that hash table. Keep in mind!
- If the question has 'solve in log n time' and you need something to do with searching, then it's screaming for binary search, just do it, find the search space and start solving by reducing search space to get answer. 
- If array is sorted, take binary search everytime in consideration as a possible pattern
- Some problems are solved by circular logic where we have to traverse back to first element, use % operator there
- Find count of ___ or condition based subset or subsequence types of problems are either solved by sliding window or hash table or two pointers
- For recursion problems check for the first step to be taken right now, and the base case, rest of the thing will be handled by recursion itself
