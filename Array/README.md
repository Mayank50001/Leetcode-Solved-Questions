## ‚úÖ Problems Solved

| Problem Name | File | Tags | Notes |
|--------------|------|------|-------|
| Find Peak Element | `Binary Search/findPeakElement.cpp` | Binary Search | LogN peak finding |
| Sort Colors | `Hash Table/Sorting/SortColors.cpp` | Dutch National Flag | No STL sort allowed |
| Pivot Index | `Prefix Sum/findPivot-724.cpp` | Prefix Sum | Suffix trick |

---

## üß† Concepts Covered

- Traversal, Two Pointers
- Binary Search in unsorted variants
- Prefix Sum applications
- In-place sorting without sort()

---

## üìå Learnings & Mistakes

- While doing `SortColors`, I initially used brute force, but later learned the Dutch National Flag algorithm ‚Äî O(n), in-place.
- In `Find Pivot`, edge cases like left/right sums being zero were tricky.
