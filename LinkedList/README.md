## Tips to solve problems

- Always check the structure of Linked List, according to problem the linkedlist can be singly, doubly or circular(most of for cyclic and fast and slow pointer approach)
- check the direction of linkedlist to be traversed to solve problem - for example for add two numbers problem the traversing direction is forward, but for second variant of same problem, we have to traverse in reverse to find sum
- First understand the question, so that you can understand if counting is efficient or two pointers approach can be used to do the same job in one pass. Always check the constraints for linked list problems as they can describe exactly how much time our algorithm is to be allowed.
- Two pointers approach can be done using slow and fast pointer. Just understand question and find out how fast and slow pointers can be the possible fit for the solution.
- For problems where recursion works, remember that the biggest mistake of recursion problems is to think about the whole recursion tree and it's future recursion path flows, recursion has 3 rules, specify the base case, call the recursive relation based on the bigger problem and solve the smaller problem letting recursion handle the whole future cycle and  backtrack if required.
