## Tips to solve problems

- Always check the structure of Linked List, according to problem the linkedlist can be singly, doubly or circular(most of for cyclic and fast and slow pointer approach)
- check the direction of linkedlist to be traversed to solve problem - for example for add two numbers problem the traversing direction is forward, but for second variant of same problem, we have to traverse in reverse to find sum
