## Tips to solve problems

- Always check the structure of Linked List, according to problem the linkedlist can be singly, doubly or circular(most of for cyclic and fast and slow pointer approach)
- check the direction of linkedlist to be traversed to solve problem - for example for add two numbers problem the traversing direction is forward, but for second variant of same problem, we have to traverse in reverse to find sum
- First understand the question, so that you can understand if counting is efficient or two pointers approach can be used to do the same job in one pass. Always check the constraints for linked list problems as they can describe exactly how much time our algorithm is to be allowed.
